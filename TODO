- Fix remote.js: 
    - MASTER/SLAVE controllers (handle tests) + RemoteWorkerPool/RemoteWorker (pings)
    - multiple TEST_MONITOR.on('...') on slaves across tests 
    - master can't handle multiple test runs
- Use git submodules
- Console webpage (stats)
- Console webpage (node manager)
- Write sample reporting app that monitors cpu, mem, disk io read + write + wait
- Better handling for failed http connections (net.Stream.connect currently calls destroy if there's an error)
- Update READMEs
- Write a DEVELOPERS doc that explains the components
- Add an error log
- Add zipf number generator
